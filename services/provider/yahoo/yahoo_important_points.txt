Findings for Yahoo Finance Provider:

1. Tick Data Timestamp:
   - Format: System Time (UTC)
   - Type: Epoch Milliseconds
   - Note: The provider sets the timestamp using `int(time.time() * 1000)` in `message_handler`.

2. Intraday Data Timestamp:
   - Returned Time: Naive Market Time (Treated as UTC).
   - `yfinance` download is called with `ignore_tz=True`. This usually results in candles having the local market time (e.g., 15:25 for Last Update in India) but without timezone info.
   - The provider then does `dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)`.
   - **Result**: A candle happening at 15:25 IST is stored as `15:25 UTC`. This implies there is a timezone offset discrepancy in the stored data (it is effectively stored as Market Time, not True UTC).

3. Daily Data Timestamp:
   - Returned Time: Midnight (Naive -> UTC).
   - Date string becomes `YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00`.
   - Provider forces invalid UTC timezone onto it.
   - Result: `2026-01-20 00:00:00+00:00`.

4. Data Format for Requests:
   - Request inputs are standard Python `datetime` objects.
   - The provider passes them to `yfinance.download`.
   - `yfinance` handles the necessary conversions internally.
